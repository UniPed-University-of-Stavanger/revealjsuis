# ChatGPT and LLMs in education

---

## Is this new? and how does it work?
- Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) and similar large language models existed for few years now (at least 2018)
- They work using a deep neural network to predict the next word in a sentence based on the input
- Newer models are trained on more data as therefore have better generative abilities 
- Their main strength is structuring data from various sources based on the input
- ChatGPT is the same but is trained to sound humanlike to make the existing technology more accessible.

## Capabilities and limitations in higher ed
- It can be used to generate written materials such as summaries, explanations, and sample responses to questions.
- Structure bulk data (like notes, documentations and interview scripts) into formats that can be used in databases
- However, it is limited to the training data to pool information and not able to be creative or create new knowledge.

## Where is this going, and can it be censored?
- ChatGPT was just a research review of the technology that is soon to be part of office 365 & Bing search. Google and other companies already have their own models which are in the implementation phase.
- In few years, this could also become an integral part of any LMS to help give prompt insights into the educational process, student contribution and streamlining communications. 
- There is no reliable method to detect AI generated text.

## What does it mean for higher education. 
- while such technologies can be thought of as nothing it can be thought of as nothing different than a paper mill. Their ease of use and accessibility greatly affects lower-level assessments which could be prevalent at a bachelor level
    - such assessments are based on reaggregating existing knowledge that could be perceived by the students as an empty exercise in assembling syntax, as opposed to a work of thinking and analysis. 
- Such tools make it more urgent to modernize higher education and rethink the value it gives to student during their time there.
- This creates an opportunity to reexamine the values we attach to what we ask students to do in the assessment context.
- Teachers need to put more effort in using writing as a tool of assessment to demonstrate learning.

## How can teachers deal with it in their classrooms?
- First, its best that the teachers introduce such tools with their capacities and limitations to the students themselves. Which means the teachers need to be competent and understanding in such technologies.
    - Otherwise, you run the risk of students using them for academic dishonesty & unknowing of their inner workings and limitations and take their generative text as automatically truthful.
    -While it is just meant to sound coherent and confident regardless of the actual contents. 
    - Therefore, they need to emphasize the importance of verifying information
- Teachers need to make their writing assessments more valuable and worthwhile, ideally sparking more creativity.
- Teachers need to discuss the reasons behind their assessments with students and connect that to the ethics of using AI in their works.

## What can be done at a university level
- Rethink what is plagiarism and if AI text falls within that. 
- Offer their educators AI competency so then can use it as a tool for learning
    - that could be done very effectively if both the teacher and the student know how to use such tools to expand their own creativity 
- Consider if the ability of using AI tools is a real world "market" skill that their graduates will be expected to use to be competitive in the job market
- Focus on building strong relationships like mentoring and professional relationship with learners and providing them with access to valuable networks and resources that they can access only within academic institutions.
- while such tools offer great language accessibility for many learners of different backgrounds. Institutes should be weary that stigma of using these tools doesnâ€™t target second language learners under the assumption that they are incapable of producing the quality of writing on their own
